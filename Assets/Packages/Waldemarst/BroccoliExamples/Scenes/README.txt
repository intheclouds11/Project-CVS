You can start with 01-Basic scene, which contains the most basic setup to generate Broccoli Trees. From there you may pick any other scene to continue.

If you are using URP or HDRP each example scene will try to rebuild the trees to that pipeline. 
* Take note that for other existing Materials and Prefabs in the scene you will need to convert them using Unity's  URP or HDRP Wizard.
